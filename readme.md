# ensembl-funcgen
The Ensembl Funcgen API (Application Programme Interface) serves as a middle layer between the underlying MySQL database and aims to encapsulate the database layout by providing high level access to the database. The team providing the data is Ensembl Regulation, but for historic reasons, the API and databases are called Funcgen.


## Usage

To clone and to bring onto your bash path use the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-funcgen.git
```

## API requirements
In order to use the Regulation API, an installation of the same version of the Ensembl-core API is mandatory. A guide for installing all Ensembl APIs and their prerequisits is available here:
