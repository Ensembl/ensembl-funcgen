This document details the various stages of the eFG release cycle.


:::: Introduction


:: Internal handovers and DB naming conventions

During a release cycle a controlled DB naming convention is used in line with the informal handovers 
we have throughout the regulatory build process.

1	Dev		e.g. dev_homo_sapiens_funcgen_55_37

Any pre reg build production data, including array mapping, annotated_feature or external data 
updates. If no regulatory build is required for a given species, then this will be the only DB name
used before the final prd DB name.


2	Build	e.g. build_homo_sapiens_funcgen_55_37

This should be used only for DBs which have a full healthchecked version of the regulatory feature structures.


3	Annot 	e.g. annot_homo_sapiens_funcgen_55_37

Reg feature annotation updated and validated.


4   Production e.g. homo_sapiens_funcgen_55_37

The unprefixed DB naming convention will be explicitly reserved for the final production version.





:: Declaration of Intentions

This list should contains items which are more than likely going to make the next release:

	RegulatoryBuild updates
	ExternalFeature updates
	Array Mapping/Xref updates
	AnnotatedFeature updates
	Other data updates
	New DBs
	Methodology updates
	Major API changes
	Major Schema changes




:::: Pre Genebuild Handover

Load any supporting/attribute sets
Update external sets
Array mapping, genomic alignments? Can we do this now we are storing unmapped objects i.e. can we migrate?

Regulatory Build (separate doc?)
Regulatory Annotation




:::: Post Genebuild Handover










:::: Post eFG Handover


:: Dynamic Content

There are several pages which contain eFG data, these should be given cursory checks for each applicable species.

Region in detail

	RegulatoryFeatures
	Bounds displayed?
	Colour annotations?
	zmenu correct?

	cisRED/miRanda/VISTA
	Only for Human and Mouse???	
	



:: Static Content

There are several static content pages which may need updating if the eFG data or methodologies have changed:

	public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/info/docs/funcgen/index.html
	Update if any part of the Regulatory Build has been redone.

	public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/info/docs/microarray_probe_set_mapping.html
	Update if array mapping strategy has changed.
