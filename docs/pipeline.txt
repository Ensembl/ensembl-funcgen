:::: The Ensembl Functional Genomics Pipeline Environment ::::

This document details the configuration and functionality available using the eFG 'pipeline' 
environment. The eFG pipeline environment provides basic configuration and support for specific 
eFG analysis environments (e.g. arrays.env, peaks.env), along with command line access to various 
functions which provide administrative support to the Ensembl genebuild pipeline technology.

3 Pre-requsites/Requirements

bioperl-1.2.3

ensembl

ensembl-functgenomics

ensembl-analysis

ensembl-pipeline

All the above ensembl packages and bioperl are available via CVS following the instructions here:
http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_installation.html

unix/linux

bash

perl (prefereably 5.8.8)

LSF
Not strictly essential as the pipeline code will run offline, but it would take a long time to run 
these analyses using one machine.

Also see main pipeline docs (see below).

4 The Ensembl Pipeline

The main documentation for the Ensembl pipeline is available here:

http://cvs.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ensembl-doc/pipeline_docs/the_ensembl_pipeline_infrastructure.txt?view=markup

In summary, the ensembl-pipeline code deals with submission of jobs to the farm dependant on a set 
of rules which describe the dependancies of each analysis step in a given pipeline. The rules and 
job tracking information are stored in a special pipeline DB which contains a few extra tables for 
the pipeline data. This can be your output DB, but for the purposes of safety, the eFG environment 
always uses a separate DB to handle this information, named using the environment name e.g.

array_pipeline_homo_sapiens_funcgen_54_37p

This also means no post pipeline clean up is required, whilst maintaining the ability to retain job 
information should it be required.

There are two configuration files which should be considered:

ensembl-pipeline/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Pipeline/Config/General.pm.example

This contains some general pipeline set up which is largely over-ridden by more specific parameters 
within the arrays environment. Make sure the following are correct for your installation:

	BIN_DIR  => '/software/ensembl/bin',
	LIB_DIR  => '/usr/local/ensembl/lib',


ensembl-pipeline/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Pipeline/Config/BatchQueue.pm

This contains the general pipeline configuration and specific configuration for how each analysis job
should be run on the farm. A template file should be available for the efg analysis environment (see
specific analysis documentation e.g. arrays.txt). It may be necessary to alter some of the general 
pipeline configuration.
