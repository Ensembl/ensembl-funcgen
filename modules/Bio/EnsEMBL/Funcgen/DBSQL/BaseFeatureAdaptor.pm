=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Funcgen::DBSQL::BaseFeatureAdaptor - Funcgen Feature Adaptor base class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Abstract class - should not be instantiated.  Implementation of
abstract methods must be performed by subclasses.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a base adaptor for Funcgen feature adaptors. This base class is simply a way
to redefine some methods to use with the Funcgen DB.

### To do ###
#Add Translation method for fetch by FeatureSets methods?
#Test and implement feature mapping between coord systems
#Correct/Document methods!!!
#Implement externaldb db_name version registry

=head2 generic_fetch

  Arg [1]    : (optional) string $constraint
               An SQL query constraint (i.e. part of the WHERE clause)
  Arg [2]    : (optional) Bio::EnsEMBL::AssemblyMapper $mapper
               A mapper object used to remap features
               as they are retrieved from the database
  Arg [3]    : (optional) Bio::EnsEMBL::Slice $slice
               A slice that features should be remapped to
  Example    : $fts = $a->generic_fetch('contig_id in (1234, 1235)', 'Swall');
  Description: Wrapper method for core BaseAdaptor, build seq_region cache for features
  Returntype : ARRAYREF of Bio::EnsEMBL::SeqFeature in contig coordinates
  Exceptions : none
  Caller     : FeatureAdaptor classes
  Status     : at risk

  #seq_region_cache other wise non-slice based fetch methods fail

  #build seq_region cache here once for entire query
  #Using default schema_build here
  #So would need to set dnadb appropriately
  #This is cleaning tmp cache values such that
  #nested feature fetches cause failure e.g. when regfeats retrieve their reg_attrs
  #We need a way of always generating the tmp cache, or having it persist?
  #This is because we haven't built the tmp cache in non_slice based methods i.e. we haven't run get_seq_region_id_by_Slice
  #This is the same for all non-Slice based methods

# Currently over-riding this method in SetFeatureAdaptor

# SetFeatureAdaptor::_analysis_id_table_syn which would return the relevant set table name and syn
# BaseFeatureAdaptor::_analysis_id_table_syn would simply return the _main_table syn

#Should this use the cache via AnalysisAdpator::fetch_by_logic_name?
#As _logic_name_to_constriant does?
#_logic_name_to_constraint returns undef if logic_name is not known
# allowing caller to return [] early.
# How would this work in compose_constraint?
# simply delete this first if exists
# How does this work wrt redundancy between constraints and optional_constraints

# For generic methods, there is a slight redundancy in calling
# the _main_table method
# Can we call this in compose_constraint and pass to contrain method
