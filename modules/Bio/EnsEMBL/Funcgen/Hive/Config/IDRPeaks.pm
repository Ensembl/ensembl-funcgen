=head1 NAME

    Bio::EnsEMBL::Funcgen::Hive::Config::IDRPeaks;

=head1 SYNOPSIS


=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 CONTACT

    Please contact http://lists.ensembl.org/mailman/listinfo/dev mailing list with questions/suggestions.

package Bio::EnsEMBL::Funcgen::Hive::Config::IDRPeaks;

use strict;
use warnings;

use base ('Bio::EnsEMBL::Funcgen::Hive::Config::BaseSequenceAnalysis');
# All Hive databases configuration files should inherit from HiveGeneric, directly or indirectly


=head2 default_options

    Description : Implements default_options() interface method of
    Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::HiveGeneric_conf that is used to initialize default options.

=cut


sub default_options {
  my $self = shift; 
  #Define any optional params here as undef
  #If they are mandatory for one analysis, but optional for another
  #will have to catch that in the runnable
  return 
   {
    %{$self->SUPER::default_options},        
  
    ### THIS NEEDS REWORKING FOR IDRPEAKS ###
   };
}


=head2 pipeline_wide_parameters

    Description : Interface method that should return a hash of pipeline_wide_parameter_name->pipeline_wide_parameter_value pairs.
                  The value doesn't have to be a scalar, can be any Perl structure now (will be stringified and de-stringified automagically).
                  Please see existing PipeConfig modules for examples.

#Can we move some of these to Base.pm config?

sub pipeline_wide_parameters {
  my $self = shift;
               
  return 
   {
    %{$self->SUPER::pipeline_wide_parameters},
    
    #Arg! we can use this approach if we are reusing an analysis?
    #As there is no way of there is no way of the analysis knowing which param to use?
    #
    
    can_run_SWEmbl_R0005_replicate => 1, 
    can_DefineMergedDataSet    => 0, 
   };
}


=head2 pipeline_create_commands

    Description : Implements pipeline_create_commands() interface method of
      Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::HiveGeneric_conf that lists the commands
      that will create and set up the Hive database.

=cut

## WARNING!!
## Currently init_pipeline.pl doesn't run this method when a pipeline is created with the -analysis_topup option



=head2 pipeline_analyses

    Description : Implements pipeline_analyses() interface method of
      Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::HiveGeneric_conf that defines the structure of the pipeline: analyses, jobs, rules, etc.

#(2) The hive_capacity worker limiting mechanism that was in place for years is going to change slightly.
#The old meanings of the values were:
#	negative value  : checking is switched off in this particular analysis
#	zero		: no workers will be allowed to take this analysis
#	missing value   : sets the default, which is 1
#	positive value	: (including the 1 by default) this analysis is limited by the given value
#This was counter-intuitive, because by default there was already a limit, which people had to raise or switch off if they needed.
#Now, since we also have an alternative mechanism (analysis_capacity), I'd like to make both mechanisms "off" by default
#(missing value will mean "checking is switched off").
#
#So please, please, please - check whether your pipeline *RELIES* on the current default behaviour
#(which is "if you don't specify -hive_capacity, the system will set it to 1
#and will not allow any workers of other analyses to take any jobs while this analysis is running").
#
#If you know/find out that your pipeline *RELIES* on this functionality, please explicitly set -hive_capacity => 1 in the corresponding analyses.
#This will make your pipeline compatible with future releases of the Hive system.

  #We need this to run otherwise we will lose the association between
  #the IDR output (SWEmbl params) and the FeatureSet it is to be associated with
  #As such we need identical working analysis config here and in DefineOutputSets.pm
  #We could separate this and require/import it?
  #might be tricky with variable scoping
