=head1 NAME

    Bio::EnsEMBL::Funcgen::Hive::Config::DefineMergedDataSets;

=head1 SYNOPSIS


=head1 DESCRIPTION

    Please contact http://lists.ensembl.org/mailman/listinfo/dev mailing list with questions/suggestions.

package Bio::EnsEMBL::Funcgen::Hive::Config::DefineMergedDataSets;

use strict;
use warnings;

use base ('Bio::EnsEMBL::Funcgen::Hive::Config::BaseSequenceAnalysis');
# All Hive databases configuration files should inherit from HiveGeneric, directly or indirectly

#todo this change to Signal/Wiggle.pm config 
#with DefineSetInputs and DefineSets as shared analyses

#We really want to be able to genericise this such that we can swap out
#any given Runnable/DB. Move all specific options to parameters sections
#specific for that analysis


=head2 default_options

    Description : Implements default_options() interface method of
    Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::HiveGeneric_conf that is used to initialize default options.

=cut


sub default_options {
  my ($self) = @_;
 
  #Define any optional params here as undef
  #If they are mandatory for one analysis, but optional for another
  #will have to catch that in the runnable
  
  return 
   {
    %{$self->SUPER::default_options},        
   };
}


=head2 pipeline_wide_parameters

    Description : Interface method that should return a hash of pipeline_wide_parameter_name->pipeline_wide_parameter_value pairs.
                  The value doesn't have to be a scalar, can be any Perl structure now (will be stringified and de-stringified automagically).
                  Please see existing PipeConfig modules for examples.

=cut


sub pipeline_wide_parameters {
  my $self = shift;
               
  return 
   {
    %{$self->SUPER::pipeline_wide_parameters}, 
    can_DefineMergedDataSet => 1,#'DefineMergedDataSets',
    #Set to the config name so the configure_pipeline script knows to reset these jobs 
    
    #These are not strictly needed for DefineMergedDataSets
    #As this is always used in conjunction with Peaks and/or Collections
    #But need these here as we are now using MutliConfigLinker 
    #which requires these params
    #can_Link_to_Peaks       => 0,
    #can_Link_to_Collections => 0,
   };
}



=head2 pipeline_create_commands

    Description : Implements pipeline_create_commands() interface method of
      Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::HiveGeneric_conf that lists the commands
      that will create and set up the Hive database.

=cut

## WARNING!!
## Currently init_pipeline.pl doesn't run this method when a pipeline is created with the -analysis_topup option



=head2 pipeline_analyses

    Description : Implements pipeline_analyses() interface method of
      Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::HiveGeneric_conf that defines the structure of the pipeline: analyses, jobs, rules, etc.

#(2) The hive_capacity worker limiting mechanism that was in place for years is going to change slightly.
#The old meanings of the values were:
#	negative value  : checking is switched off in this particular analysis
#	zero		: no workers will be allowed to take this analysis
#	missing value   : sets the default, which is 1
#	positive value	: (including the 1 by default) this analysis is limited by the given value
#This was counter-intuitive, because by default there was already a limit, which people had to raise or switch off if they needed.
#Now, since we also have an alternative mechanism (analysis_capacity), I'd like to make both mechanisms "off" by default
#(missing value will mean "checking is switched off").
#
#So please, please, please - check whether your pipeline *RELIES* on the current default behaviour
#(which is "if you don't specify -hive_capacity, the system will set it to 1
#and will not allow any workers of other analyses to take any jobs while this analysis is running").
#
#If you know/find out that your pipeline *RELIES* on this functionality, please explicitly set -hive_capacity => 1 in the corresponding analyses.
#This will make your pipeline compatible with future releases of the Hive system.

	  -parameters => {set_type        => 'ResultSet'},
	  	  
  	 #These are always created, even if we have used analysis_top_up
  	 #hence at the start of the next conf, we will get input_ids which are data flown
  	 #Do we even want to redo this?
  	 # as this forces use to funnel
  	 #when what we really want is to data flow directly from batch job to batch job
  	 #Do we need a sparse shared batch job analysis?
  	 
  	 #regardless, the way to fix this is probably to remove these from here
  	 #and use seed_pipeline after init_pipeline
  	 #seed pipeline func could automatically print out the jobs created? 
	 #can seed pipeline use the existing meta table params?
	 #So init will do the validation and seed pipeline will simply
	 
	 #This is actually fine here, as this is the very first 
	 #shared IdentifySetInputs analysis
	 #Although we should probably make this consistent across the pipelines
	 #How do we catch mistyped options?
	 #Need to put these in pipeline_wide_parameters otherwise they won't be caught?
	 #This won't give us the ability to translate between input_sets and set_names
	 #This won't matter as the specificity will be implied by the logic_name
	 #although not in the meta table
	 #Not too happy about separating the input_id definition from this config
	 
	 #Putting them in pipelinewide params offers not advantage
	 #and may prevent using seed_pipeline again, as it would require 
	 #init_pipeline to be run again, probably unsafe for various reasons
	 #including over-writing of meta params
	 #let's write our own seed_pipeline script
	 #which calls hive seed_pipeline, but we catch opts better
	 #and optionally print input_id as output(all or newly seeded)
	 #this would also handle array args!

      #IDR/Replicate Implementation
      #We will need additional semaphored data_flow to run_peak_replicates here
      #to support replicate calling and IDR QC
      #This needs to wait for all replicate sets to be peak called
      #but ignore the rest(we don't want to wait for merged replicate peaks)
      #there is no way of doing this without splitting the whole analysis tree from
      #here i.e. DefineOutputSet?!!!
      #it's clear that implementing IDR optionally along side merged peak calling 
      #in the same pipeline is going to be tricky
      #This would need to flow to another link analysis(if >1 is supported)
      #Something like Run_IDR_QC
      #That link analysis would pick up the groups of input_set_ids
      #do the IDR across the linked FeatureSets and the submit another merged 
      #peak job.
      #This would mean duplicating the peak analyses as we can't loop back due to semaphore
      #IdentifyFeatureSets(or more likely PeaksReport) would also have to be semaphored from here
      #and receive the output of all peak jobs from both originally merged and IDR jobs?
      #No, we can handle this with status entries
      #Further more PreprocessALignment should not data flow to WriteCollections if it is 
      #a replicate
      
      #How can we semaphore an analysis(PeaksReport) which doesn't exist in this config?
      #would have to do this through the link analysis
      #This would wait for everything hanging of DefineOutputSet before commencing 
      #the link analysis, which would then run the IDR and merged peaks, before doing the final 
      #PeaksReport
      #This would also wait for Collections! So we would have to detach that analysis somehow
      #or split DefineOutputSet into DefineReplicateOutputSet and DefineOutputSet
      #VERY COMPLICATED!!!
