=head2 default_options

    Description : Implements default_options() interface method of 
                  Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::HiveGeneric_conf that is used
                  to initialize default options.

#These are used by init_pipeline.pl and according to the docs should the pipelinedb spec
#Anything set (e.g. test) in default_options will be accessible in other methods here 
#(e.g pipeline_wide_params, pipeline_create_commands) as $self->o(test), 
#unless specified on the cmdline in which case that will be the value of $self->o(test);
#This is basically mechanism to remove the needs for doing soemthing like this f
#or defaults in pipeline_wide_params: test => $self->o('test') || default_value
#or: test => (defined $self->o('test')) ? $self->o('test').'/ing' : '/default/ing'
#$self->o also captures undefined cmdline params, if they have not been set in defaults

#There seems to be no clear reason for not setting params in here, if we never want to set 
#a hardcoded default for them which we might want to over-write with a specific cmdlind opt
#in pipeline_wide_parameters

#It looks like it is possible to refer to a previously defined option within the same hash

=head2 pipeline_wide_parameters

    Description : Interface method that should return a hash of pipeline_wide_parameter_name->pipeline_wide_parameter_value pairs.
                  The value doesn't have to be a scalar, can be any Perl structure now (will be stringified and de-stringified automagically).
                  Please see existing PipeConfig modules for examples.
