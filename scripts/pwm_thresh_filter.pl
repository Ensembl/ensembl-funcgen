=head1 DESCRIPTION

Little utility for filtering PWM mappings using the output of pwm_filter_mappings.pl

Input comprises a thresholds file as produced by ensembl-functgenomics/scripts/pwm_filter_mappings.pl and a number of original mappings files.

It expects to find the original mappings in the current working directory in files with names like jaspar.version.mappings eg MA0012.1.mappings. Typically these will have been created by using ensembl-functgenomics/scripts/pwm_genome_map.pl followed by ensembl-functgenomics/scripts/pwm_filter_mappings.pl.

Output files have names like MA0012.1.pwm_map and are written to the directory specified on the command line with -o




=head1 USAGE

The output directory must already exist, this script will not create it.

=head1 EXAMPLES

pwm_thresh_filter.pl -i thresholds  -o filtered/
