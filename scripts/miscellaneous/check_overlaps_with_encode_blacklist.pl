=head1 NAME

check_overlaps_with_blacklist.pl - For all the human annotated features, checks how they overlap with a set of locations defined as being problematic by the ENCODE project (so called blacklist). Produces log files of the overlap analysis.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

check_overlaps_with_blacklist.pl -efgdb_host dbhost -efgdb_port dbport -efgdb_user dbuser -efgdb_name dbname\
    -coredb_host dnadbhost -coredb_port dnadbport -coredb_user dnadbuser -coredb_name dnadbname\
    -remove -output overlaps.txt -feature_set fset1 fset2 ...

    -efgdb_pass          Password fof the eFG DB
    -coredb_host         Host for Core DB [$DNADB_HOST]
    -coredb_port         Port for Core DB [$DNADB_PORT]
    -coredb_user         User for Core DB [$DNADB_USER]
    -coredb_name         Name of Core DB [$DNADB_NAME]
    -remove              When specified it removes the overlapping features from the database 
    -output              File to store results of analysis  [overlaps.txt]
    -all                 When specified all sets are considered

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Downloads datasets in the data tracking database. Updates their download status.
