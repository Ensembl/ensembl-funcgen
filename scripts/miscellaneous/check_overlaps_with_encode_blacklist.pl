=head1 NAME

check_overlaps_with_blacklist.pl - For all the human annotated features, checks how they overlap with a set of locations defined as being problematic by the ENCODE project (so called blacklist). Produces log files of the overlap analysis.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

check_overlaps_with_blacklist.pl -dbhost dbhost -dbport dbport -dbuser dbuser -dbname dbname\
    -dnadb_host dnadbhost -dnadb_port dnadbport -dnadb_user dnadbuser -dnadb_name dnadbname\
    -remove -output overlaps.txt -feature_set fset1 fset2 ...

Options:

  Mandatory:
    -feature_sets        Space-separated list of names of feature sets for which to check the overlap

  Optional:
    -dbhost          Host for eFG DB [$DB_HOST]
    -dbport          Port for eFG DB [$DB_PORT]
    -dbuser          User for eFG DB [$DB_USER]
    -dbname          Name of eFG DB [$DB_NAME]
    -dbpass          Password fof the eFG DB
    -dnadb_host      Host for Core DB [$DNADB_HOST]
    -dnadb_port      Port for Core DB [$DNADB_PORT]
    -dnadb_user      User for Core DB [$DNADB_USER]
    -dnadb_name      Name of Core DB [$DNADB_NAME]
    -remove          When specified it removes the overlapping features from the database 
    -output          File to store results of analysis  [overlaps.txt]
    -all             When specified all sets are considered

#To do
# 1 Set BLACKLIST_FILTERED status?
# 2 add -slices -skip_slices support
# 3 Move to a module so it can be re-used in the pipeline and via stand alone script
# 4 refine log output
# 5 add RF and MF support? Shouldn't need this is we always filter after peak calling.
