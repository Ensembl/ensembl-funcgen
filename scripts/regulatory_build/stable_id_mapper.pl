 -slice_name        The name of a slice to run. This must not be run in parallel as stable IDs are 
                    incremented within this script, not by MySQL. Running in parallel will result in
                    duplicate new stable IDs, re-run with clobber to correct this.

 -assign_all_nulls  If running in slice mode with a new assembly, this ensures that all remaining 
                    RegualtoryFeatures which have not been processed will be assigned a stable ID.  
                    This should only be used when processing the last slice. Turning this on before
                    processing the final slice will result in all remaning features being assigned 
                    new rather than mapped stable IDs(this can be fixed by running the problem 
                    slices with -clobber, but will obfuscate which seq_regions have been 
                    successfully mapped).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<This program> compares an existing set of Regulatory Features against a new set by performing
overlap analysis to project stable IDs onto the most appropriate new feature. As old and new features 
can overlap, there is always the possibilty of finding a better match than the first encountered.
This is overcome by building chains of overlapping features, taking the 5' most old feature and retrieving 
each new feature on this slice, then reciprocated using the new feature until we exhaust all overlapping 
old and new features in a given chain. Once we have built a chain and stored the overlap qualities of each 
transition from old to new or vice versa, then we can work backwards through the chain applying rules to 
each transition to denote which new feature inherits which stable ID, and which stable IDs are merged, 
split or retired.  Once this has been done any remaining non-overlapping new features are assigned a new 
stable ID.

Rule hierarchy for projecting or inheritance of stable IDs, given that the previous fails to resolve the mapping,
 are as follows:

1. Maximum overlap

old     --a--
new   -b-  --c-

c would inherit from a.
b would be given a new stable ID, but the split of a would be recorded as a > a(c) & b

2. Maximum coverage

old     --a--
new   -b-- --c----

b would inherit from a. Split behaviour is recorded as above.

3. Least displaced

old  ------a----
new    -b-  -c-

b would inherit from a as it is most central to a.

4. Maximum parents

old -x- ---a---
new   -b--   --c-

b would inherit from a as it has another parent regulatory feature.
x would get retired, with the split being recorded.
c would get a new stable id, again with the split of a being recorded

The above examples are just some very simplistic representations and there is obviously the possiblity to have many
combinations of overlap behaviour.  Due to the uncertainty of inheritance of linking overlaps in a chain, it is 
sometimes necessary to traverse 1 or two links before we can assign stable IDs and know the full split/merge behaviour.


????  In the case of a truely unresovled mapping do we take the 5', or do we split and retire ????

Some more examples:

old -x- ---a---
new   -b-     -c-

x>b due to coverage
a>c as b has already had an ID assigned

In reality this assignment is done in reverse, as when considering a, we don't know what might map to be, so we have 
to move the next transition before we discover x is a better match for b, then assign a to c.

???? Are we handling the assignment of a to c properly ???????????????????


example of normal first to previous bahviour here

This can get extremly complicated:

old --a--- c- --c1---- e- e1
new	-b- --b1-----  --d------

Here we have walked through a chain of ever extending or at least stable length linking overlaps.
The mapping for this chain would be as follows:

Walking forwards:

a > b b1
b is marked as the 'child' due to coverage.
b1 is an unknown so we have to wait until we have done the reverse walk to record the split of a properly

b1 > c c1
c1 is marked as 'child' (or more appropriately parent in the case of a new to old transition), however we don't
know whether c1 will have a better match, so we still need to move to the next transition before resovling this mapping.
c is marked as 2nd best or 'previous_child' due to coverage when compared with a, in case c1 is used for something else.

c1 > b1 d
waa waa oops, cannot resolve this yet as we don't know the number over coverage of parents of d, b1 get's marked as child,
but a flag is set to mark d as a twin to b1 in the next transition. This will be used in the reverse walk to make a 
comparison between the parents of d and b1.

?? should we not mark e as 2nd best so if b1 would inherit from c1, d would inherit from e??????????????????????????????????????????????


d > c1 e e1
c1 get marked as child(parent) due to overlap


Now we walk backwards through the chain to resolve the mappings

d > c1 e e1
Natural choice would be c1 due to the maximum overlap, but we know that d is a twin b1 with respect to c1.  So now we 
consider the b1 > a c c1 mapping against the current transition.  We see each has an equal number of parents but e1 has
better coverage than a, so we assign c1 to d and record the merge of e and e1 into d(c1). Potentially, if this were a truly 
symmetrical overlap neighbourhood, this would still be unresolved.  In this case we would split and retire c1 and take the
next best i.e. c > b1 and e > d.

??? We need to generate a sub to do this ??????

c1 > b1 d
We already know c1 has been assign to d, so we move on.  If this were not the case then we'd assign it to the recorded child
i.e. b1

b1 > a c c1
The child for this is c1, but we already know this has been taken so we use the 2nd best which is c

a > b b1
The child for this is b, we know this has not yet been assigned to, and we know there are no more transitions, so we assign
a to b.



things we need to implement on the back of this
recording of 2nd best mappings only immediately after a twin?
a sub loop to handle the bidrectional walking given a twin

what is the concept of a RegulatoryFeature?
It can cross cell/tissue types but have differing modifications, hence states
but maintain same stable_id
This makes mapping between assembly variable region extremely hard
we need to take account of multi cell/tissue types in some way.
we need to factor this into the schema

#To do

#1 Run on toplevel non-ref, now added, but what impact will this have?
#2 remove empty files
#3 Implement HealthChecker/Helper for logging and check_stable_ids sub
#4 Implement assembly mapping
#5 Implement recover properly, cannot do for sub slices due to chaining
#  Also mapped feature count may not always match old feature cnt
#  Currently just redoes any slice with mismatched counts
#  Mapped count is based on whole slice not just feature slice
#  Should get same results due to chaining, but need to check
#6 Verbose level logging?
#7 Blast based mapping for none assembly mapped regions?
#8 Do we rollback new stable IDs when rerunning i.e. are we reusing new stable IDs?
#9 Add mapping reason to output
#10 Copy stable_ids to other feature_sets no ending in _v[0-9]+
#11 Fix problems running with Y PAR! Currently we just clobber those assigned 
#   via the X mapping uneccesarily increments the new stable ID number. 
#12 DONE Need to log which slices are left when throwing
