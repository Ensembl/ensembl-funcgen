These run.sh scripts provide some example templates for the tool scripts present under this directory.
As they are quite numerous, you might find that some of the options for a particular run script might 
not have been updated in line with the script it is associated.  If warnings or errors occur due to 
absent mandatory options or defunct options, please check the perl script for documentation.
