# Load data from a file of regulatory regions into a database

#To do
#remove get_all_regulatory_features from Gene.pm
#do we need some different feature tables for these high volume features?
#how would we trace this feature_type association...in feature_set, feature_type column?
#would be feature_type for most, maybe rna_feature and/or motif_feature
#store influence and evidence in a functional xref table?
#set analysis and ftype adaptor internally?
#implement version in xref to denote version of stable id and hence implicitly release of core DB
#Or implement release in external_db?
#can we use linkage annotation in object_xref?

Usage: perl $0 <options>

  -host    Database host to connect to

  -port    Database port to connect to

  -dbname  Database name to use

  -user    Database username

  -pass    Password for user

  -type    Type of regulatory features to upload; must be present in analysis table and
           have a correspoinding parser e.g. vista, cisred, miranda.

  -file    File to load data from; must be parseable by parser corresponding to type

  -clobber Delete all features from type feature_set(s) before loading

  -archive Specify a version suffix to move the old feature_set to e.g. 47 will move feature_set to feature_set_name_v47

  -old_assembly, -new_assembly If *both* these options are specified, co-ordinates will be
           projected from the old assembly to the new assembly before being stored. This
           relies on a suitable mapping between the two assemblies having already been 
           carried out.
