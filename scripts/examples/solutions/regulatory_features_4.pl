#Ensembl Regulatory Build lacks specificity of classification with many unclassified, also has potential resolution issues. Also does no explicitly annotate 'dead' regions/
#Conversely...
#ENCODE segmentation lacks restricted to 6 cell types, as well as potential fragmention issues. No common feature location definition across cell lines. No MultiCell summary set. ~Genomewide coverage,
