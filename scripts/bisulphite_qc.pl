=head1 NAME

 bisulphite_qc.pl
  
=head1 SYNOPSIS

 bisulphite_qc.pl /path/to/bed/dnamethylationfeature_bed_file.bed
 
 Quality control check for DNAMethylationFeature bed files 

=head1 OPTIONS

perl bisulphite_qc.pl /path/to/dnamethylationfeature_bed_files/GM12878/GM12878_5MC_ENCODE_HAIB.bed

The only required argument is a DNAMethylationFeature bed file in Ensembl specific DNAMethylation bed format.
The output will be generated in the same directory in which the programme is run.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program computes fraction of methy-cytosines at each individual read depth between 1 and 100 and clubs everything
beyond 100 into one group.
The results are plotted into separate line charts for each cytosine context in the bed file using R. 


=head1 output

Text file for each of the cytosine contexts
R code file to generate the plots
Pdf of plots

# Here I'm checking methylation level for the cytosine and if it is greater than 0, the cytosine is considered to be methylated.
# However instead of using a 0 value, a better estimate for considering unmethylation would be very useful. This could be probably 
# done through computing a non-conversion/error rate estimation by aligning raw reads against mitochondrial genome which is not
# supposed to contain any methylation and the fraction of mitochondrial cytosines found methylated can be used here for unmethylation.
