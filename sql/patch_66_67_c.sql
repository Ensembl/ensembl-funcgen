/** 
@header patch_66_67_c.sql - result_feature.remove_partitions
@desc   Remove window_size based partitions as this table should now 
        only hold 0bp data i.e. array data
*/

-- Currently don't use this table but maintain array support for now.

-- Need to conditionally exit if we see window_size !=0
-- Can't do this without defining stored construct (e.g. procedure or function)
-- exit via this construct would leave it in place and requiring tidy up
-- Hence exit, and require manual patch?
-- Rerunning patch after data clean up will remove stored contruct!

--   IF n !=0 THEN select "You have ";
--    END IF;

-- Can't use exit from within procedure or function
-- Will have to wrap up entire patch in function?
