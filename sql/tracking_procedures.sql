--  1 SumariseRegBuild uses meta string to build summary
--  2 SummariseCellType takes a varchar

-- Could also have SummariseExperiments which would take a FeatureType or a CellType
-- and summarise all the experiments for the given type.


-- This is a procedure not a function as we don't return a value
-- we simply perform a select

-- We can probably split this up, so we have a *private* procedure to populate
-- cell_type/feature_type records:
--  _UpdateFeatureTypeSummary
--  _UpdateCellTypeSummary
-- As these are private, we can force the use of passing NULL, to mean
-- use the meta entries


-- Or should these have function wrappers? So we don't have to use call?

-- we need separate procedures for Seg and Reg build
-- RegBuild, should have no limitations on feature types
-- Or can we add separate columns to support seg and non-seg ftypes?
-- This might be useful to find celltypes which have a wealth of histones/TFs
-- but a relative paucity of of seg ftypes

-- to do, turn this in to a func, so we don't have to use 'call'
